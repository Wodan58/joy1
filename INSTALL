Joy1 installation manual
========================

To install Joy1, you first need to build it. For this, you have two choices:
you can go for Joy1 with the Boehm GC or you can just as well build it without
garbage collector. The latter version is easier, since the source code is
self-contained.

Joy1 without GC
---------------

To build Joy1 without GC, all you need to do is call ``make'' which detects the
absence of the GC and builds the GC-less variant (NOBDW) of Joy1. You can find
it as statically built ``joy'' binary in the root folder.

Joy1 with GC
------------

To build Joy1 with the GC, you need to download the Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage
collector from <http://hboehm.info/gc/>. The original Joy1 source code used
gc6.0 but that doesn't seem to build properly these days. This code was
adjusted to build and work with version 7.2e, the last one without libatomic_ops
requirement.

Download the GC tarball into the Joy1 directory and unpack it. If you're not
using version 7.2, update the 'gc' symlink, so ``make'' can find your desired
garbage collector.

After that, you only need to call ``make''. It will detect your garbage
collector, configure it and build it locally. After that it will build Joy1 and
link it together with the GC. This results in the statically build ``joy''
binary (BDW) in the root folder.
